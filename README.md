Get rock **HARD**, bro!

## Introduction
It's a daunting task to get into shape. Often times, people will feel discouraged from building healthy fitness habits because of their lack of knowledge on where to start. Information online is abundant, but so much so that it's difficult to filter out what is applicable to yourself. When it comes to working out at the gym, we've also noticed that there's a lack of community. Introducing Rock Hard, this app is geared towards active gym-goers and those looking to get into physical fitness. Most gym apps function more as a tool, and less as a social space. There's a numerous amount of calorie counters, workout planners, and dieting planners, and while those are valid, we feel like there's certain elements missing; namely, being able to communicate with other gym-goers and the app's ease of use are often lacking.

## User Story
Brandy makes the same New Year resolution every year; to get fit! Brandy goes to her nearest gym for about two weeks. Brandy feels like she doesn’t know the appropriate exercises to do nor does she know the correct way to use the machines. This makes Brandy feel really sad. It also does not help that Brandy feels very self conscious working out alone. Also, Brandy suffers from depression. Eventually, Brandy stops going to the gym. Jeepers!


One evening on Brandys commute home she heard a group of people talking about an app called Rock Hard. Brandy quickly got home downloaded the app. She created her profile, plugged in the gym she plans to attend and uploaded her “before”pic for the progress tracker. The app generated a list of users that also attend the same gym as Brandy so she views their profile until she finds her perfect buddy.


Brandy meets Dylan three times a week at the gym where they encourage, and hold each other accountable to meet their goals. They have very similar workouts because with the apps ModelTargetAreas they saw they had similar body types and had many of the same target areas to improve. They feel confident with these provided workout suggestions because with the apps AR feature they are able to preview the correct posture and position for each machine at the gym.  Outside of the gym Brandy counts her calories with the apps CaloriesTracker, and uses the MealPrepGuide for healthy meal suggestions.
Brandy is now 32 lbs lighter and feeling fit and better than ever. She is excited to update her progress and load a pic for comparison to where she started. But this isn’t the end for Brandy, she may end up using the app from a personal trainer’s point of view next!
